# Unmute
*Documentation Last Updated: 08/08/2025*
## Project Abstract
A **minimalistic** web-based meeting app.
## Story
I decided to design this app when I grew tired of using "limited meeting apps". As a student and startup member who joins meetings a lot, all the apps I tried either had limited meeting time for free, the need to download the client, and/or the requirement to create an account. Moreover, little to none of them had AI integrated in them for assistance. 

I found all of the above surprisingly absurd (except the meeting time limit because I'm aware of server cost). So, "Unmute" was born. 
## Features
- Text Communication
- Voice Communication
- Screen Sharing
## Specialties
- No account required
- No limits on meeting
- No download required
## Future-Work Intentions
- AI Integration: 
  - Nothing too crazy but at least some sort of "suggestions", "analysis of contribution", etc. 
- Efficient Meetings
  - The aim is to provide seamless connection by avoiding unnecessary features. 
- And more! 
## Conclusion
Thank you for reading this far! And thank you to all the contributors :)
