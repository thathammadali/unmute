# Unmute
*Documentation Last Updated: 08/08/2025*

## Abstract
**Unmute** is a **minimalistic, web-based meeting app** designed for students, startups, and small teams who value speed, simplicity, and seamless connectivityâ€”without bloatware, sign-up walls, or unnecessary restrictions.

## Motivation & Story
As someone who attends meetings regularlyâ€”both as a student and a startup memberâ€”I became frustrated with mainstream meeting apps. Most either:
- Limit meeting duration on free plans
- Require downloading a desktop/mobile client
- Force users to create an account before joining

And almost none integrate even basic AI to make meetings more efficient.

So, I decided to build **Unmute**: a fast, no-install, no-account-required meeting app designed for hassle-free communication.

## Features
- **Text Communication** â€“ Instant messaging for meeting participants
- **Voice Communication** â€“ Real-time audio conferencing
- **Screen Sharing** â€“ Share your screen without extra plugins

## Specialties
- **No Account Required** â€“ Join instantly, no sign-ups
- **Unlimited Meetings** â€“ No arbitrary meeting caps
- **Web-Only** â€“ Works directly in your browser, no downloads

## Future Plans
- **AI Integration** â€“ Basic yet useful AI features such as:
  - Contribution analysis
  - Smart meeting summaries
  - Participation suggestions
- **Optimized Performance** â€“ Keep connections stable and lag-free by avoiding feature bloat
- **Community-Driven Features** â€“ Build what users actually need

## Conclusion
**Unmute** aims to keep meetings simple, fast, and accessible for everyone. Whether youâ€™re collaborating on a class project or running a startup meeting, the goal is the same: **connect instantly, without distractions**.

Special thanks to all current and future contributors who will help make Unmute even better ðŸš€
